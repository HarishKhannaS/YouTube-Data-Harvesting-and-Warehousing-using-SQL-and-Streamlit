       "  'Vid_Description': '#madhampattyrangaraj #madhampatty \\n\\nArisi paruppu sadam is a classic South Indian dish made by cooking rice and lentils together with spices like cumin, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. It\\'s nutritious, flavorful, and often served with accompaniments like pickle, papad, or yogurt. The lentils add protein and texture to the rice, making it a wholesome meal on its own or as a side dish.\\n\\nCoimbatorians love Arisi Paruppu Sadham as much as they love Biriyani. You will definitely love this dish once you taste it. This is such a healthy food option as well.\\nAs this one is everyone\\'s favorite dish,We serve this dish in our recently opened restaurant, \"Kovai Cafe,\" which is located in California.\\n\\nWe will see how to prepare this in simple home-style cooking. The ingredients that we need to prepare this dish are: oil, mustard seeds, dry red chillies, curry leaves, green chillies, small onion, turmeric powder, Sambhar powder, salt, grated coconut, garlic, pepper, cumin seeds, and coconut oil.\\n \\nLet\\'s start to prepare this dish. Add oil and wait till the oil is heated. Add mustard seeds to it and let it splutter. Add dry red chillies, curry leaves, and turmeric powder for color. Green chillies, as per your spice preference, Add small onions (this is preferred as it elevates the taste of the dish). We have washed and soaked 1/2 kg of rice and 150 grams of toor dal for this dish.\\n \\nNow, further saute until the small onion turns golden. Here, add 2 cubed tomatoes and sauté further until the tomatoes turn mushy. Now add 2 teaspoons of sambhar powder and mix well.\\n \\nIf all the ingredients are ready with you, this dish can be prepared within 10 minutes. This delicious dish goes well with potato and brinjal fry, which can be prepared with very simple and basic ingredients such as Sambhar powder and salt. This dish can also be served with pickles and curd. If my mother makes this dish, it tastes so good that I eat it first without any side- dishes, then I eat it with pickles, then with potato and brinjal fries, and then I eat it twice with curd. Everyone, do try this recipe and let me know.\\n \\nAnd now that the masala and all the tomatoes are well cooked, we can add salt as per preference and add cups of water. You can see the color; it is bright red. I added more spice because I like my food to be spicy. You can add them according to your preference and spice tolerance level. At this stage, we can add the soaked rice and dal to this and let it boil. We can now close the lid and pressure cook for 3 whistles. Now that it is done, wait for the most delicious dish, Arsiyum Paruppum.\\n \\nIn this meantime we will make an another outstanding dish, Potato brinjal fry. Take equally cubed potato and brinjal, mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry red chillies and Sambhar powder and Salt.\\n \\nTake a pan and add oil. This dish is going to be a bit spicy and crunchy, as we are not going to boil and fry anything; we are just going to sauté them all. Once the oil is heated, add mustard seeds and let it splutter. Add dry red chilies and curry leaves, add 2 tablespoons of sambhar powder, and sauté them. Now immediately add potatoes and brinjal to this, and you can see how well the sambhar powder and oil are blended with the ingredients. Now let them cook on a low flame. You can now add the required amount of salt to this and mix them well.\\n \\nLet them cook until the brinjal shrivels well. As this looks so appealing, I feel like I want to eat it right away while cooking. Let them cook slowly on a low flame. Add a small amount of water and let it roast well.\\n \\nThe aroma of the rice is great.Now that the third whistle has also come, you can turn off the flame for the rice. Here, the potato and brinjal are also cooked wonderfully. You can even eat these piping hot, sauteed veggies. Make sure you cut the vegetables into cubes.This makes an excellent combination for arisi paruppu sadham and curd rice. You can see how well the brinjal is cooked and shriveled. Add some curry leaves to this, and it is done. We can now release the pressure of the cooker and add coarsely crushed pepper, cumin seeds, crushed garlic, and grated coconut to this. Now drizzle coconut oil on this and give it a good mix so that all the ingredients get mixed. Finally, add coriander leaves to this and mix them as well.\\n \\nNow that arisi paruppu sadham is ready, serve it hot along with pickles, potato-brinjal fry, and curd.Taste them along with every single side dish that has been served.Yumm!! This tastes delicious!!

       "  'Vid_Description': \"#madhampattyrangaraj #madhampatty #catering \\n\\nThe Culinary Logistics of Chennai Marathon: A Gastronomic Spectacle\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nThe Chennai Marathon stands as a testament to human endurance, community spirit, and health consciousness. Behind this remarkable event lies a lesser-known but equally crucial aspect: food production and distribution. As thousands of participants traverse the city streets, replenishing their energy becomes paramount. This essay delves into the intricate logistics of food production for the Chennai Marathon, highlighting the meticulous planning and execution required to satisfy the appetites of both runners and spectators.\\n\\nPreparation and Planning:\\nMonths before the marathon, meticulous planning commences to ensure a seamless food experience for participants. Event organizers collaborate with local vendors, caterers, and food suppliers to curate a diverse menu that caters to varying dietary preferences and requirements. From carbohydrates to proteins, fruits to energy bars, the menu is crafted to provide runners with the necessary nutrients to fuel their journey.\\n\\nFood Production:\\nOn the day of the marathon, the culinary extravaganza begins before dawn breaks. Teams of chefs and kitchen staff work tirelessly to prepare massive quantities of food. Kitchens buzz with activity as ingredients are chopped, cooked, and assembled into nutritious meals. Hygiene and food safety protocols are strictly adhered to, ensuring the health and well-being of all participants.\\n\\nDistribution and Logistics:\\nAs the sun rises, the focus shifts to distribution and logistics. Stations are strategically set up along the marathon route, manned by volunteers ready to serve hungry runners. Trucks loaded with food supplies navigate the bustling streets of Chennai, ensuring timely replenishment of supplies at each station. Communication channels remain open and efficient, allowing for quick adjustments in case of unforeseen circumstances.\\n\\nSustainability and Waste Management:\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainability and waste management in event planning. The Chennai Marathon is no exception. Efforts are made to minimize food waste through careful portion control and donation of surplus food to local charities. Biodegradable packaging and utensils are used wherever possible, reducing the event's environmental footprint.\\n\\nCommunity Engagement:\\nThe Chennai Marathon is not just a sporting event; it's a celebration of community spirit. Food plays a vital role in fostering this sense of camaraderie. Spectators line the streets, cheering on runners while enjoying delicious snacks and refreshments. Food stalls offering local delicacies further enhance the festive atmosphere, providing a culinary journey through Chennai's rich gastronomic heritage.\\n\\nThe culinary logistics of the Chennai Marathon are a testament to the power of collaboration, efficiency, and innovation. Behind the scenes, a dedicated team works tirelessly to ensure that participants and spectators alike are nourished and energized throughout the event. As runners cross the finish line, their sense of accomplishment is matched only by the satisfaction of a well-deserved meal, marking the culmination of a gastronomic spectacle unlike any other.\\n\\n©️Madhampatty Rangaraj \\n\\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/madhampatty_rangaraj?igsh=aHhnNTJiaHl0aDJ6\\n\\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/Madhampatty?mibextid=opq0tG\\n\\nX : https://x.com/madhampattyrr?s=21\\n\\n\\n✉️ranga@madhampattygroups.com\",\n",
